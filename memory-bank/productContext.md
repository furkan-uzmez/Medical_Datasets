# Product Context

## Why this project exists
Medical imaging reports often describe findings in natural language. "Grounding" these reports means mapping specific phrases in the report to specific regions in the image. This project likely aims to facilitate research, model training, or analysis using the PadChest dataset with these grounded annotations.

## Problems it solves
- Handling complex medical datasets (PadChest).
- Parsing and utilizing "grounded" annotations (linking text to image coordinates/masks).
- Providing a structure for experimenting with this data.

## User Experience Goals
- Efficient data loading and processing.
- Clear pipelines for handling the specific formats (JSON grounded reports).
- Reproducible research/analysis workflows.
