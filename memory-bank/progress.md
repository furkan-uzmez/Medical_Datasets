# Progress

## Status
-   **Project Status**: Active Construction & Verification
-   **Memory Bank**: Updated & Synchronized

## What Works
-   [x] **Project Structure**: Defined root README and workspace layout.
-   [x] **Data Analysis**: `analysis.ipynb` and `analysis2.ipynb` provide deep insights.
-   [x] **Data Processing**: `convert_to_binary_csv.py` successfully creates the binary dataset.
-   [x] **Training Pipeline**: `train.py` is functional with logging and checkpointing.
-   [x] **Evaluation Pipeline**: `evaluate_torch_script.py` calculates comprehensive metrics.
-   [x] **Documentation**: Memory Bank updated; Project READMEs created.

## What's Left to Build
-   [ ] **Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning for the ResNet model.
-   [ ] **Advanced Modeling**: Implement multi-label classification (beyond binary).
-   [ ] **Grounding**: Implement logic to utilize the bounding box data in `grounded_reports.json`.
-   [ ] **COVID-CXNet**: Deep dive into the second dataset.

## Known Issues
-   None currently blocking.
