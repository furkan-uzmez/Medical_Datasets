# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- **Initialization**: Setting up the Memory Bank and understanding the project structure.
- **Data Exploration**: Understanding the contents of `dataset/` to plan next steps.

## Recent Changes
- Created Memory Bank structure (`memory-bank/` directory and core files).

## Next Steps
- Populate `requirements.txt` based on project needs.
- Explore the contents of `dataset/` specifically the JSON structure.
- Define a clear goal for the data usage.

## Active Decisions
- Using `memory-bank/` directory for documentation to keep root clean.
