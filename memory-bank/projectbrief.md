# Project Brief: PadChest-GR

## Overview
PadChest-GR appears to be a project focused on working with the PadChest dataset, specifically leveraging "Grounded Reports" (GR). The presence of `grounded_reports_20240819.json` and `master_table.csv` suggests data analysis, processing, or modeling tasks related to chest X-ray reports where finding links between text and image regions (grounding) is key.

## Core Goals
- Process and analyze PadChest grounded reports.
- Utilize the dataset located in `dataset/` specifically `grounded_reports_20240819.json`.
- (Inferred) Develop models or tools to interact with this medical imaging data.

## Project Scope
- Input: PadChest dataset (CSV, JSON, Images).
- Output: TBD (Analysis, Trained Models, Cleaned Data).
